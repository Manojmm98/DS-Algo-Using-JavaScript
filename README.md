Data Structure and Algorithim Using JavaScript 
-----------------------------------------------

All the Data Structure and Alogrithim concept will be covered here with Examples

1- Big O Notaion
   A - Time Complexity
   B - Space complexity

To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
